    <h1 style ="text-align: center;">A Story</h1>
    <h2 style ="text-align: center;"><u>Day the Earth Shook</u></h2> <br>
    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">
        Mira was sipping coffee in her small apartment in Aruvale when the ground began to tremble. At first, it felt <br>
        like a truck passing by—but within seconds, her floor shook violently, books fell, glass shattered, and her cat <br>
        darted under the bed.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">
        She ran to the doorway as the earthquake roared around her. Walls groaned. The power cut out. Outside, <br>
        screams and sirens filled the air.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">
        When it finally stopped, her neighborhood was cracked and broken—but alive. People wandered out of their <br>
        homes in shock. Mira found her elderly neighbor injured and sat beside him silently, sharing the moment.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">
        In the days that followed, strangers became friends. Mira, once quiet and alone, found herself helping others, <br>
        feeling connected for the first time in years.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">
        The earthquake had shaken more than buildings—it had shifted something inside her, too.

    <h1 style ="text-align: center;">A Poem</h1>
    <h2 style ="text-align: center;"> <u>Earthquake She Slept Through</u></h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">-Mary Jo Bang</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">
        She slept through the earthquake in Spain. <br>
        The day after was full of dead things. Well, not full but a few. <br>
        Coming in the front door, she felt the crunch of a carapace <br>
        under her foot. In the bathroom, a large cockroach <br>
        rested on its back at the edge of the marble surround; the dead <br>
        antennae announced the future by pointing to the silver eye <br>
        that would later gulp the water she washed her face with. <br>
        Who wouldn't have wished for the quick return <br>
        of last night's sleep? The idea, she knew, was to remain awake <br>
        and while walking through the day's gray fog, trick the vaporous <br>
        into acting like something concrete: a wisp of cigarette smoke, <br>
        for instance, could become a one-inch Lego building <br>
        seen in the window of a bus blocking the street. <br>
        People sometimes think of themselves as a picture that matches <br>
        an invented longing: a toy forest, a defaced cricket, the more <br>
        or less precious lotus. The night before the quake, she took a train <br>
        to see a comic opera with an unlikely plot. She noticed a man <br>
        in a tan coat and necktie who looked a lot like Kafka. <br>
        The day after, she called a friend to complain about the bugs. <br>
        From a distant city—his voice low and slightly plaintive—he said,<br>
        Aren't you well? Is there anything you want?
